👋 Hi there! I'm currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. I’m passionate about AI, multimodal learning, and real-world applications of large models.

🤝 I'm always open to collaboration! If you have a research idea or want to work together in any project, feel free to reach out — I’d love to connect (hjiangbg@connect.ust.hk).
